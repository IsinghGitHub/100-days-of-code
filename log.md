# 100 Days Of Algorithm and DataStructure Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Coded and Documented on the three popular algorithms BinarySearch, Bubblesort, SelectionsSort

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed refreshing the college level basics. Hope to master it by 100th Day.

### Day 2: January 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Documented on Algorithm Time Complexity . Imporved the BubbleSort code for best case. Learned InsertionSort code.

**Thoughts:** Time and Space Complexity is most important aspect of the code.

### Day 10: January 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: LinkedList

A singly linked list is a list with only one pointer between two successive nodes. It can only
be traversed in a single direction, that is, you can go from the first node in the list to the last
node, but you cannot move from the last node to the first node.
